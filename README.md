# Satoshi - Sirius Emails 2009-2011

## Rizzn's Note

Forked this from the original upload Sirius made for his website. Gonna add in community analysis, and clean up the outputs a bit. Follow it for updates. (I might rename this repo, possibly, because Adam Back just released some emails via the Craig trial, and they'd go very well in this repo as a combo item. We'll see).

## Original Note from Sirius (Martti Malmi)

This repository contains the correspondence between myself (Martti Malmi, AKA Sirius) and Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. I did not feel comfortable sharing private correspondence earlier, but decided to do so for an important trial in the UK in 2024 where I was a witness. Also, a long time has passed now since the emails were sent. 

The archive is incomplete and contains only emails from my address @cc.hut.fi. My university email addresses changed to @aalto.fi in early 2011, and I don't have backups of those emails. There are some passwords and a street address mentioned in the emails, but those are no longer valid or relevant.

## Repository Contents

- `satoshi.html`: The original HTML archive of the emails.
- `satoshi.md`: A markdown version of the email archive.
- `satoshi.json`: A JSON file containing structured data extracted from the markdown file.
