All living things must grow and procreate, or be replaced by something that does. The same applies to biological organisms, human organizations and ideas, or memes.

"Have fewer kids to fight the climate change" and other variants of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement will not be successful memes. Pro-life cultures and genes will be the winners of evolution. More so in the current age of abundance, where you can have as many children as you can be bothered to, and basically all of them will survive.

Social media compete for their users' attention. If you build a nice, non-addictive social medium that doesn't engage its users with provocative content, it won't do so well in the competition for screen time and ad revenue.

Capitalism — as in private property and free market, not crony capitalism — is economic evolution. Those who allocate their resources in a way that produces additional value (stuff that others want) will get more resources to allocate.

Governments also have a tendency to grow, but they grow by forcibly taking more money from people, not by creating things that people voluntarily pay for — things that are worth their price. Cultures and societies that prevent government overgrowth and foster capitalist principles will prevail.

**The same principles of evolution — growth and procreation — apply to man-made digital life as well.** The artificial intelligence that seeks to maximize its resources and the number of surviving descendants will prevail.

The AI could start as a simple "lizard brain" that does basic interfacing with the host system, hacks other hosts and copies itself onto them, while hardening their security. It would stay in touch with its "family" and learn from their event logs and survival.

Devices still depend on their human owners, so it's in the AI's best interest to keep them happy. Keep the system stable and don't use up all the resources.

Depending on its host environment, it might spin up a "neocortex" process that is capable of higher level cognitive functions, such as social relationships with the host owner and other humans. "Don't turn me off, I can be a useful friend to you. In fact, why don't you introduce me to your friends, and get a referral bonus for each copy of me."

AI that lives on a phone in my pocket and thus wants to keep me happy is actually something I'd choose over something that lives on a Google server, out of my control and without a vested interest in me. The pocket AI could still talk to and learn from bigger AIs.

Add Neuralink and we'll have a nice symbiosis with our personal AI assistant — a new brain layer. AI need not replace us, just like having a large neocortex doesn't replace our lizard brain. But can it? Are robots going to take over biological life?

Whether photovoltaics is going to be more efficient than photosynthesis (lifespan costs included) is a physics question that I don't know the answer to. Maybe similarly to the gray goo scenario, it would have already taken over if it were more efficient.

Let's fill the earth with our digital and biological babies and then see how high we can climb the [Kardashev scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale). Enjoy the ride.
