Some of their responses were rather Neanderthal, although I\nguess they're so used to being anti-fiat-money that anything short of\ngold isn't good enough.  They concede that something is flammable, but\nargue that it'll never burn because there'll never be a spark.  Once\nit's backed with cash, that might change, but I'd probably better\nrefrain from mentioning that in public anymore until we're closer to\nready to start.  I think we'll get flooded with newbies and we need to\nget ready first.\n\nWhat we need most right now is website writing.  My writing is not that\ngreat, I'm a much better coder.  Maybe you could create the website on\nsourceforge, which is currently blank.  If you can write a FAQ, I can\ngive you a compilation of my replies to questions in e-mail and forums\nfor facts and details and ideas.\n\nCodewise, there's not much that's easy right now.  One thing that's\nneeded is an interface for server side scripting languages such as Java,\nPython, PHP, ASP, etc.  Bitcoin would be running on the web server, and\nserver side script could call it to do transactions.  It's Windows, so I\nguess OLE/COM is the interface.\n\nOne easy thing that really helps is to run a node that can accept\nincoming connections (forward port 8333 on your firewall) to make sure\nthat new users who try it out have someone to connect to.  If they run\nit and get no connections, they'll probably just give up.\n\nSatoshi\n\n\nMartti Malmi wrote:\n",

It's not intended to use all or most of the material\nhere, just pick and choose.  This is just a dump of everything I've\nanswered.\n\nSome issues that we don't have easy answers for are best not to bring\nup.  Casual users seems content to assume that the system works as\nstated (which it does), and getting into the design details just opens a\ncan of worms that can't be answered without a deep understanding of the\nsystem.

I'm not clear what the \"blocks\" figure describes.

Every Bitcoin node\ndisplays the same number and it goes up about every 10 minutes whenever\nsomeone generates a block.  When you haven't had it running for a while,\nonce you're connected it spins up rapidly as it downloads what was\ngenerated while you were gone to catch up.  I'm not sure exactly how to\ndescribe it (that would fit on the status bar in 1 word, maybe 2 words\nmax), any ideas?\n\nThe blocks number in the status column next to your transactions is the\nnumber of blocks that have come after that transaction.  Your\ntransaction is essentially \"in\" that many blocks.\n\nSatoshi\n\n\n\n\n> My best guess - it\n> is the length of the global chain, and the rapid advance at the start\n> is as the software downloads and verifies the preceding blocks in the\n> chain as being valid.\n\nRight.  I'm trying to think of more clear wording for that, maybe \"%d\nnetwork blocks\" or \"%d block chain\".\n\n\n\n\n\n> I'm having an unusual run of (block not-accepted) failures, and\nthought I'd let you know in\n> case this was of any significance.\n\nWhat rate of not-accepted did you see?  I didn't see anything unusual on\nmy end.  If you had more than, say, 4 in a row, that would be abnormal\nand probably a loss of network communication.  If it's scattered and\nless than 25%, just random bad luck.  It's normal and harmless to\nrandomly get some per cent of not-accepted, and of course randomness can\nsometimes bunch up and look like a pattern.\n\nThe idea of an option to View/Hide unaccepted blocks is a good one, as\nwell as View/Hide all generated blocks so you can more easily see\nincoming transactions.  Seeing the unaccepted blocks is just annoying\nand frustrating.  Everyone faces the same rate of unaccepted, it's just\na part of the process.  It would probably be best to default to hide\nunaccepted blocks, so as not to show giving and taking away something\nthat never was, and not show new generated blocks at all until they have\nat least one confirmation.  It would only mean finding out you have a\ngenerated block 15 minutes later than normal, and then you still have\n119 blocks to go before it matures anyway.  This is on the to-do list\nfor v0.1.6.\n\nSatoshi\n\n\\[note: I have some improvements in 0.1.6 to reduce this problem somewhat,\nand it'll also improve when the network is larger\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> For some reason your transfer to me shows up as \"From: unknown\" even\n> though I added you to my address book.\n>\n> I have a \"Generated (not accepted)\" line in my transaction list, it\n> seems like an attempt to generate a coin went wrong somehow. Not sure\n> what happened here - presumably my node successfully solved a block\n> but then I went offline before it was sent to the network?\n\nTransactions sent to a bitcoin address will always say \"from: unknown\".\nThe transaction only tells who it's to.  Sending by bitcoin address\nhas a number of problems, but it's so nice having the fallback option to\nbe able to send to anyone whether they're online or not.  There are a\nnumber of ideas to try to improve things later.  For now, if things work\nout like the real world where the vast majority of transactions are with\nmerchants, they'll pretty much always make sure to set up to receive by\nIP.  The P2P file sharing networks seem fairly successful at getting a\nlarge percentage of their users to set up their firewalls to forward a port.\n\nI badly wanted to find some way to include a comment with indirect\ntransfers, but there just wasn't a way to do it.  Bitcoin uses EC-DSA, which\nwas essential for making the block chain compact enough to be practical with\ntoday's technology because its signatures are an order of magnitude smaller\nthan RSA.  But EC-DSA can't encrypt messages like RSA, it can only be used\nto verify signatures.\n\nThe \"Generated (not accepted)\" normally happens if two nodes find a\nblock at close to the same time, one of them will not be accepted.  It's\nnormal and unavoidable.  I plan in v0.1.6 to hide those, since they're\njust confusing and annoying and there's no reason for users to have to\nsee them.  While the network is still small like it is now, if you can't\nreceive incoming connections you're at more of a disadvantage because\nyou can't receive block announcements as directly.\n\n\n\n\n> ...So far it has two \"Generated\" messages, however the\n> \"Credit\" field for those is 0.00 and the balance hasn't changed.

Bitcoin can already scale much\nlarger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It\nnever really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over\nthe ways it would cope with extreme size.\n\nBy Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5\nyears and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy\nadoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of\ntransactions.\n\nI don't anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it\nbecomes too burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that\nonly processes transactions that include a transaction fee.  The owner\nof the node would decide the minimum fee they'll accept.  Right now,\nsuch a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if\nenough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they\ninclude a fee, or slower if they don't.  The fee the market would settle\non should be minimal.  If a node requires a higher fee, that node would\nbe passing up all transactions with lower fees.  It could do more volume\nand probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions\nas it can.  The transition is not controlled by some human in charge of\nthe system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.\n\nA key aspect of Bitcoin is that the security of the network grows as the\nsize of the network and the amount of value that needs to be protected\ngrows.  The down side is that it's vulnerable at the beginning when it's\nsmall, although the value that could be stolen should always be smaller\nthan the amount of effort required to steal it.  If someone has other\nmotives to prove a point, they'll just be proving a point I already concede.\n\nMy choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an\neducated guess.  It was a difficult choice, because once the network is\ngoing it's locked in and we're stuck with it.  I wanted to pick\nsomething that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but\nwithout knowing the future, that's very hard.  I ended up picking\nsomething in the middle.  If Bitcoin remains a small niche, it'll be\nworth less per unit than existing currencies.  If you imagine it being\nused for some fraction of world commerce, then there's only going to be\n21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per\nunit.  Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is\nrepresented internally as 100000000.  There's plenty of granularity if\ntypical prices become small.  For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro,\nthen it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed,\nso if you had 1 Bitcoin it's now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is\ndisplayed as 1.\n\nRipple is interesting in that it's the only other system that does\nsomething with trust besides concentrate it into a central server.\n\nSatoshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> If we assume that 0.1% is a good risk rate, then z=5 thus\n> any transaction must wait a bit less than an hour before being\n> solidified in the chain. As micropayments for things like web content\n> or virtual goods are by definition something that requires low\n> overhead, waiting an hour seems like quite a significant hurdle.\n\nFor the actual risk, multiply the 0.1% by the probability that the buyer\nis an attacker with a huge network of computers.\n\nFor micropayments, you can safely accept the payment immediately.  The\nsize of the payment is too small for the effort to steal it.\nMicropayments are almost always for intellectual property, where there's\nno physical loss to the merchant.  Anyone trying to steal a micropayment\nwould probably not be a paying customer anyway, and if they want to\nsteal intellectual property they can use the file sharing networks.\n\nCurrently, businesses accept a certain chargeoff rate.  I believe the\nrisk with 1 or even 0 confirming blocks will be much less than the rate\nof chargebacks on verified credit card transactions.\n\nThe usual scam against a merchant that doesn't wait for confirming\nblocks would be to send a payment to a merchant, then quickly try to\npropagate a double-spend to the network before the merchant's copy. What\nthe merchant can do is broadcast his transaction and then monitor the\nnetwork for any double-spend copies.  The thief would not be able to\nbroadcast during the monitoring period or else the merchant's node would\nreceive a copy.  The merchant would only have to monitor for a minute or\ntwo until most of the network nodes have his version and it's too late\nfor the thief's version to catch up and reach many nodes.  With just a\nminute or two delay, the chance of getting away without paying could be\nmade much too low to scam.  A thief usually needs a high probability of\ngetting an item for free to make it worthwhile.  Using a lot of CPU\npower to do the brute force attack discussed in the paper in addition to\nthe above scam would not increase the thief's chances very much.\n\nAnything that grants access to something, like something that takes a\nwhile to download, access to a website, web hosting, a subscription or\nservice, can be cancelled a few minutes later if the transaction is\nrejected.\n\n\n> How is the required difficulty of each block communicated through the\n> network and agreed upon?\n\nIt's not communicated.  The formula is hardcoded in the program and\nevery node does the same calculation to know what difficulty is required\nfor the next block.  If someone diverged from the formula, their block\nwould not be accepted by the majority.\n\n\n\n\n\n> Is the code free/open source or just open source?\n\nIt's free open source.  It's the MIT license, which just requires some\ndisclaimer text be kept with the source code, other than that you can do\njust about anything you want with it.  The source is included in the\nmain download.\n\nSatoshi\n\n\n\n\n\n> Is there a way to be told of new versions? Does the app auto update\n> itself?

After a year, you could generate 12 cents.  That's not going to\nmake it so people can just generate all the bitcoin they want for spending.\n\nThe value of bitcoins would be relative to the electricity consumed to\nproduce them.  All modern CPUs save power when they're idle.  If you run\na computational task 24/7, not letting it idle, it uses significantly\nmore power, and you'll notice it generates more heat.  The extra wattage\nconsumed goes straight to your power bill, and the value of the bitcoins\nyou produce would be something less than that.\n\n\n> Why would they, when they make money by generating\n> new ones\n\nNo, they can't make money that way.  It would cost them more in\nelectricity than they'd be selling the bitcoins for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, people have taken up scarce commodities as money, if\nnecessary taking up whatever is at hand, such as shells or stones.  Each\nhas a kernel of usefulness that helped bootstrap the process, but the\nmonetary value ends up being much more than the functional value alone.\nMost of the value comes from the value that others place in it.  Gold,\nfor instance, is pretty, non-corrosive and easily malleable, but most of\nits value is clearly not from that.  Brass is shiny and similar in\ncolour.  The vast majority of gold sits unused in vaults, owned by\ngovernments that could care less about its prettiness.\n\nUntil now, no scarce commodity that can be traded over a communications\nchannel without a trusted third party has been available.  If there is a\ndesire to take up a form of money that can be traded over the Internet\nwithout a TTP, then now that is possible.\n\nSatoshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> As more capable\n> computer hardware comes out, the natural supply per user\n> doubles at every cycle of Moore's law.\n\nActually, that is handled.  There's a moving average that compensates\nfor the total effort being expended so that the total production is a\nconstant.  As computers get more powerful, the difficulty increases to\ncompensate.\n\n\n> I do not recall any economic history of a commodity subject\n> to natural inflation ever being used as money\n\nThere's gold for one.  The supply of gold increases by about 2%-3% per\nyear.  Any fiat currency typically averages more inflation than that.\n\n\n\n> Won't there be massive inflation as computers get faster and are able\nto solve the proof-of-work problem faster?\n\nThe difficulty is controlled by a moving average that compensates for\nthe total effort being expended to keep the total production constant.\nAs computers get more powerful, the difficulty increases to compensate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> If someone double spends, then the transaction record\n> can be unblinded revealing the identity of the cheater?\n\nIdentities are not used, and there's no reliance on recourse.

Think 6\ndegrees of freedom -- it spreads exponentially.  It would only take\nsomething like 2 minutes for a transaction to spread widely enough\nthat a competitor starting late would have little chance of grabbing\nvery many nodes before the first one is overtaking the whole network.\nDuring those 2 minutes, the merchant's nodes can be watching for a\ndouble-spent transaction.  The double-spender would not be able to\nblast his alternate transaction out to the world without the merchant\ngetting it, so he has to wait before starting.\n\nIf the real transaction reaches 90% and the double-spent tx reaches\n10%, the double-spender only gets a 10% chance of not paying, and 90%\nchance his money gets spent.  For almost any type of goods, that's\nnot going to be worth it for the scammer.\n\nInformation based goods like access to website or downloads are\nnon-fencible.  Nobody is going to be able to make a living off\nstealing access to websites or downloads.  They can go to the file\nsharing networks to steal that.  Most instant-access products aren't\ngoing to have a huge incentive to steal.\n\nIf a merchant actually has a problem with theft, they can make the\ncustomer wait 2 minutes, or wait for something in e-mail, which many\nalready do.  If they really want to optimize, and it's a large\ndownload, they could cancel the download in the middle if the\ntransaction comes back double-spent.  If it's website access,\ntypically it wouldn't be a big deal to let the customer have access\nfor 5 minutes and then cut off access if it's rejected.  Many such\nsites have a free trial anyway.\n\nSatoshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[in response to a question about scale\\]\n\n100,000 block generating nodes is a good ballpark large-scale size\nto think about.  Propagating a transaction across the whole network\ntwice would consume a total of US$ 0.02 of bandwidth at today's\nprices.  In practice, many would be burning off excess allocated\nbandwidth or unlimited plans with one of the cheaper backbones.\nThere could be millions of SPV clients.  They only matter in how\nmany transactions they generate.  If they pay 1 or 2 cents\ntransaction fees, they pay for themselves.  I've coded it so you\ncan pay any optional amount of transaction fees you want.  When the\nincentive subsidy eventually tapers off, it may be necessary to put\na market-determined transaction fee on your transactions to make\nsure nodes process them promptly.\n\nTo think about what a really huge transaction load would look like,\nI look at the existing credit card network.  I found some more\nestimates about how many transactions are online purchases.  It's\nabout 15 million tx per day for the entire e-commerce load of the\nInternet worldwide.  At 1KB per transaction, that would be 15GB of\nbandwidth for each block generating node per day, or about two DVD\nmovies worth.  Seems do-able even with today's technology.\n\nImportant to remember, even if Bitcoin caught on at dot-com rates\nof growth, it would still take years to become any substantial\nfraction of all transactions.  I believe hardware has already\nrecently become strong enough to handle large scale, but if there's\nany doubt about that, bandwidth speeds, prices, disk space and\ncomputing power will be much greater by the time it's needed.\n\nSatoshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> One other question I had...

A computer\nthat's half as fast would get half as many coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[question about what to backup\\]\n\nThe files are in \"%appdata%\\\\Bitcoin\", that's the directory to\nbackup.\n\n%appdata% is per-user access privilege.  Most new programs like\nFirefox store their settings files there, despite the headwind of\nMicrosoft changing the directory name with every Windows release\nand being full of spaces and so long it runs off the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[question about what to backup\\]\n\nThe directory is \"%appdata%\\\\Bitcoin\"\nIt has spaces in it so you need the quotes\ncd \"%appdata%\\\\bitcoin\"\n\nOn XP it would typically be:\nC:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\\\[username\\]\\\\Application Data\\\\Bitcoin\n\nBackup that whole directory.  All data files are in that\ndirectory.  There are no temporary files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[question about what to backup\\]\n\nThe crucial file to backup is wallet.dat.  If bitcoin is running\nthen you have to backup the whole %appdata%\\\\bitcoin directory\nincluding the database subdirectory, but even if it's not running\nit certainly feels safer to always backup the whole directory.\n\nThe database unfortunately names its files \"log.0000000001\".  To\nthe rest of the world, \"log\" means delete-at-will, but to database\npeople it means delete-and-lose-everything-in-your-other-files.  I\ntried to put them out of harm's way by putting them in the\ndatabase subdirectory.  Later I'll write code to flush the logs\nafter every wallet change so wallet.dat will be standalone safe\nalmost all the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> > You know, I think there were a lot more people interested in the 90's,\n> > but after more than a decade of failed Trusted Third Party based\nsystems\n> > (Digicash, etc), they see it as a lost cause.

I would be surprised if 10 years from now\nwe're not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know\na way to do it that won't inevitably get dumbed down when the\ntrusted third party gets cold feet.\n\nOnce it gets bootstrapped, there are so many applications if you\ncould effortlessly pay a few cents to a website as easily as dropping\ncoins in a vending machine.\n\n\\[this next bit turned out to be very controversial.  there is extreme\nprejudice against spam solutions, especially proof-of-work.\\]\n\nIt can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail.  The send dialog is\nresizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like.\nIt's sent directly when it connects.  The recipient doubleclicks\non the transaction to see the full message.  If someone famous is\ngetting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to\nhave a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and\ngive out the IP address on their website.  \"Send X bitcoins to my\npriority hotline at this IP and I'll read the message personally.\"\n\nSubscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their\nfree trial so it doesn't cannibalize subscriptions could charge\nbitcoins for the trial.\n\n\n\n\n\\[again, I don't know why I'm including this, as it's best to stay\naway from claims about spam.  people automatically react violently\nagainst any suggestion of a spam solution.\\]\n\n> Spammer botnets could burn through pay-per-send email filters\n> trivially (as usual, the costs would fall on people other than the\n> botnet herders & spammers).\n\nThen you could earn a nice profit by setting up pay-per-send\ne-mail addresses and collecting all the spam money.  You could\nsell it back to spammers who don't have big enough botnets to\ngenerate their own, helping bootstrap the currency's value.  As\nmore people catch on, they'll set up more and more phony addresses\nto harvest it.  By the time the book \"How I got rich exploiting\nspammers and you can too\" is coming out, there'll be too many fake\naddresses and the spammers will have to give up.\n\n\n\n\n> > \\* Spammer botnets could burn through pay-per-send email filters\n> >   trivially\n> If POW tokens do become useful, and especially if they become money,\n> machines will no longer sit idle.

They'd essentially be reverse-spamming the spammers with\nautomated mailboxes that collect their POW and don't read the\nmessage.  The ratio of fake mailboxes to real people could become\ntoo high for spam to be cost effective.\n\nThe process has the potential to establish the POW token's value\nin the first place, since spammers that don't have a botnet could\nbuy tokens from harvesters.  While the buying back would\ntemporarily let more spam through, it would only hasten the\nself-defeating cycle leading to too many harvesters exploiting the\nspammers.\n\nInterestingly, one of the e-gold systems already has a form of\nspam called \"dusting\".  Spammers send a tiny amount of gold dust\nin order to put a spam message in the transaction's comment field.\nIf the system let users configure the minimum payment they're\nwilling to receive, or at least the minimum that can have a\nmessage with it, users could set how much they're willing to get\npaid to receive spam.\n\n\n\n\n\n> The last thing we need is to deploy a system designed to burn all\n> available cycles, consuming electricity and generating carbon dioxide,\n> all over the Internet, in order to produce small amounts of bitbux to\n> get emails or spams through.\n>\n> Can't we just convert actual money in a bank account into bitbux --\n> cheaply and without a carbon tax?

Even if I\nwasn't using it secondarily as a way to allocate the initial\ndistribution of currency, PoW is fundamental to coordinating the\nnetwork and preventing double-spending.\n\nIf it did grow to consume significant energy, I think it would\nstill be less wasteful than the labour and resource intensive\nconventional banking activity it would replace.  The cost would be\nan order of magnitude less than the billions in banking fees that\npay for all those brick and mortar buildings, skyscrapers and junk\nmail credit card offers.\n\nSatoshi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> BTW I don't remember if we talked about this, but the other day some\n> people were mentioning secure timestamping.

A few lines of code could create a transaction with\nan extra hash in it of anything that needs to be timestamped.\nI should add a command to timestamp a file that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a thread on p2presearch which starts with my rant about trust\nbeing the root weakness of all conventional financial systems.\nhttp://listcultures.org/pipermail/p2presearch\\_listcultures.org/2009-February/thread.html\n\nI've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin.  It's\ncompletely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties,\nbecause everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust.  Give it a\ntry, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:\n\nDownload Bitcoin v0.1 at http://www.bitcoin.org\n\nThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's\nrequired to make it work.  The central bank must be trusted not to\ndebase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of\nbreaches of that trust.  Banks must be trusted to hold our money and\ntransfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit\nbubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.  We have to trust them with\nour privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.\nTheir massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.\n\nA generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar\nproblem.  Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password\nprotection to secure their files, placing trust in the system\nadministrator to keep their information private.  Privacy could always\nbe overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the\nprinciple of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his\nsuperiors.  Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and\ntrust was no longer required.  Data could be secured in a way that was\nphysically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason,\nno matter how good the excuse, no matter what.\n\nIt's time we had the same thing for money.  With e-currency based on\ncryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman,\nmoney can be secure and transactions effortless.\n\nOne of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital\nsignatures.  A digital coin contains the public key of its owner.  To\ntransfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of\nthe next owner.  Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of\nownership.  It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big\nproblem unsolved: double-spending.  Any owner could try to re-spend an\nalready spent coin by signing it again to another owner.  The usual\nsolution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for\ndouble-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model.  In its\ncentral position, the company can override the users, and the fees\nneeded to support the company make micropayments impractical.\n\nBitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for\ndouble-spending.  In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed\ntimestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin.  It\ntakes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but\nhard to stifle.  For details on how it works, see the design paper at\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\n\nThe result is a distributed system with no single point of failure.\nUsers hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with\neach other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org\n\n\n\n\n\nMartien van Steenbergen Martien at AardRock.COM\nThu Feb 12 08:40:53 CET 2009\n\nVery interesting. Is this akin to David Chaum's anonymous digital\nmoney? His concept makes sure money is anonymous unless it is\ncompromised, i.e. the same money spent more than once. As soon as it's\ncompromised, the \u2018counterfeiter\u2019 is immediately publicly exposed.\n\nAlso, in bitcoin, is there a limited supply of money (that must be\nmanaged)? Or is money created exaclty at the moment of transaction?\n\nSucces en plezier,\n\nMartien.\n\n\n\n\n\nMartien van Steenbergen wrote:\n> Very interesting.

The\nrecipient of a Bitcoin payment is able to check whether it is the first\nspend or not, and second-spends are not accepted.  There isn't an\noff-line mode where double-spenders are caught and shamed after the\nfact, because that would require participants to have identities.\n\nTo protect privacy, key pairs are used only once, with a new one for\nevery transaction.  The owner of a coin is just whoever has its private key.\n\nOf course, the biggest difference is the lack of a central server.  That\nwas the Achilles heel of Chaumian systems; when the central company shut\ndown, so did the currency.\n\n> Also, in bitcoin, is there a limited supply of money (that must be\n> managed)? Or is money created exaclty at the moment of transaction?\n\nThere is a limited supply of money.  Circulation will be 21,000,000\ncoins.  Transactions only transfer ownership.\n\nThank you for your questions,\n\nSatoshi\n\n\n\n\n\nMartien van Steenbergen wrote:\n> Reminds me of:\n>\n>     \\* AardRock \u00bb Wizard Rabbit Treasurer\n>       <http://wiki.aardrock.com/Wizard\\_Rabbit\\_Treasurer>; and\n>     \\* AardRock \u00bb Pekunio <http://wiki.aardrock.com/Pekunio>\n\nIndeed, it is much like Pekunio in the concept of spraying redundant\ncopies of every transaction to a number of peers on the network, but the\nimplementation is not a reputation network like Wizard Rabbit Treasurer.\nIn fact, Bitcoin does not use reputation at all.  It sees the network\nas just a big crowd and doesn't much care who it talks to or who tells\nit something, as long as at least one of them relays the information\nbeing broadcast around the network.  It doesn't care because there's no\nway to lie to it.  Either you tell it crypto proof of something, or it\nignores you.\n\n> Are you familiar with Ripple?\n\nAs trust systems go, Ripple is unique in spreading trust around rather\nthan concentrating it.\n\n\\[I've been asked at least 4 other times \"have you heard of Ripple?\"\\]\n\n\n\n\nMichel Bauwens wrote:\n> how operational is your project? how soon do you think people will be\n> able to use it in real life?\n\nIt's fully operational and the network is growing.

My name is Martti Malmi and my Sourceforge\naccount is sirius-m. No problem!\n\nThanks for your answered questions, I'll add them to the faq. Here's\nwhat I've done so far:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* Bitcoin FAQ \\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nGeneral Questions\n\n1 What is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital\ncurrency. Peer-to-peer (P2P) means that there is no central\nauthority to issue new money or to keep track of the\ntransactions. Instead, those tasks are managed collectively by\nthe nodes of the network. Anonymity means that the real world\nidentity of the parties of a transaction can be kept hidden from\nthe public or even from the parties themselves.\n\n2 How does bitcoin work?\n\nBitcoin utilizes public/private key cryptography. When a coin is\ntransfered from user A to user B, A adds B's public key to the\ncoin and signs it with his own private key. Now B owns the coin\nand can transfer it further. To prevent A from transfering the\nalready used coin to another user C, a public list of all the\nprevious transactions is collectively maintained by the network\nof bitcoin nodes, and before each transaction the coin's\nunusedness will be checked.\n\nFor details, see chapter Advanced Questions.\n\n3 What is bitcoin's value backed by?\n\nBitcoin is valued for the things it can be exchanged to, just\nlike all the traditional paper currencies are.\n\nWhen the first user publicly announces that he will make a pizza\nfor anyone who gives him a hundred bitcoins, then he can use\nbitcoins as payment to some extent - as much as people want pizza\nand trust his announcement. A pizza-eating hairdresser who trusts\nhim as a friend might then announce that she starts accepting\nbitcoins as payment for fancy haircuts, and the value of the\nbitcoin would be higher - now you could buy pizzas and haircuts\nwith them. When bitcoins have become accepted widely enough, he\ncould retire from his pizza business and still be able to use his\nbitcoin-savings.\n\n4 How are new bitcoins created?\n\nNew coins are generated by a network node each time it finds the\nsolution to a certain calculational problem. In the first 4 years\nof the bitcoin network, amount X of coins will be created. The\namount is halved each 4 years, so it will be X/2 after 4 years,\nX/4 after 8 years and so on. Thus the total number of coins will\napproach 2X.\n\n5 Is bitcoin safe?\n\nYes, as long as you make backups of your coin keys, protect them\nwith strong passwords and keep keyloggers away from your\ncomputer. If you lose your key or if some unknown attacker\nmanages to unlock it, there's no way to get your coins back. If\nyou have a large amount of coins, it is recommended to distribute\nthem under several keys. You propably wouldn't either keep all\nyour dollars or euros as paper in a single wallet and leave it\nunguarded.\n\n6 Why should I use bitcoin?\n\n\u2022 Transfer money easily through the internet, without having to\ntrust third parties.\n\n\u2022 Third parties can't prevent or control your transactions.\n\n\u2022 Be safe from the unfair monetary policies of the monopolistic\ncentral banks and the other risks of centralized power over a\nmoney supply. The limited inflation of the bitcoin system's\nmoney supply is distributed evenly (by CPU power) throughout\nthe network, not monopolized to a banking elite.\n\n\u2022 Bitcoin's value is likely to increase as the growth of the\nbitcoin economy exceeds the inflation rate - consider bitcoin\nan investment and start running a node today!\n\n7 Where can I get bitcoins?\n\nFind a bitcoin owner and sell her something - MMORPG equipement,\nIT support, lawn mowing, dollars or whatever you can trade with\nher. You can also generate new bitcoins for yourself by running a\nbitcoin network node.\n",

Something\nto get new users up to speed on what Bitcoin is and how to use it and\nwhy, and clean and professional looking would help make it look well\nestablished.  The site at bitcoin.org was designed in a more\nprofessorial style when I was presenting the design paper on the\nCryptography list, but we're moving on from that phase.\n\nYou should probably change the part about \"distribute them under several\nkeys\".  When the paper says that it means for the software to do it, and\nit does.  For privacy reasons, the software already uses a different key\nfor every transaction, so every piece of money in your wallet is already\non a different key.  The exception is when using a bitcoin address,\neverything sent to the same bitcoin address is on the same key, which is\na privacy risk if you're trying to be anonymous.  The EC-DSA key size is\nvery strong (sized for the future), we don't practically have to worry\nabout a key getting broken, but if we did there's the advantage that\nsomeone expending the massive computing resources would only break one\nsingle transaction's worth of money, not someone's whole account.  The\ndetails about how to backup your wallet files is in the Q&A dump and\nalso it's explained in readme.txt and definitely belongs in the FAQ.\n\nOh I see, you're trying to address byronm's concern on freedomainradio.\nI see what you mean about the password feature being useful to address\nthat argument.  Banks let anyone who has your name and account number\ndrain your account, and you're not going to get it back from Nigeria.\nIf someone installs a keylogger on your computer, they could just as\neasily get your bank password and transfer money out of your account.\nOnce we password encrypt the wallet, we'll be able to make a clearer\ncase that we're much more secure than banks.  We use strong encryption,\nwhile banks still let anyone who has your account info draw money from\nyour account.\n\n\nmmalmi@cc.hut.fi wrote:\n",

Clearly the\nbanking establishment got scared and banned your account (and founded\nwww.bitcoin.com in attempt to fetch the trademark), eh. You could ask\nif the SF staff at sfnet\\_ops@corp.sourceforge.com can help you.\n\n\nOh, that sounds tough. Take your time.\n\n\nI've been thinking about a currency exchange service that sells and\nbuys bitcoins for euros and other currencies. Direct exchangeability\nto an existing currency would give bitcoin the best possible initial\nliquidity and thus the best adoptability for new users. Everyone\naccepts payment in coins that are easily exchangeable for common\nmoney, but not everyone accepts payment in coins that are only\nguaranteed to buy a specific kind of a product.\n\nThe instructional formula for stable pricing in euros would be something like:\n\n(The amount of euros that you're ready to trade for bc + the\neuro-value of goods that other people are selling for bc) /\n(Total number of bc in circulation - own bc assets).\n\nSo if there's a total of 1M bitcoins of which you own 100K, you have\n1000 eur and no one else trades with bitcoin yet, you can safely offer the\nexchange rate of 1 eur / 900 bc, without having to devaluate\neven if everyone sold their coins to you. This could be guaranteed as\nthe minimal exchange rate, but the rate could be also higher when\ndemand is high.\n\nInitially, when others aren't yet offering anything for bitcoins, you\ncan increase your bitcoin assets cheaply - for the minimum price that\npeople bother to do the transaction for. If you had all the existing\ncoins for yourself, you could set the price to whatever you want,\nbecause you wouldn't face the risk of having to buy even a single coin\nwith that price (not counting the new money created by others). So\nit's best to get as much coins as possible before backing bitcoin with\nall your available euros.\n\nProfit can be gained, as usually in trading, by having a margin\nbetween the buying and selling prices. Making Bitcoin as usable as\npossible will make the business run better, as people do not only want\nto sell all their coins to you, but also want to buy them and use them\nas a medium of exchange.\n\nAt its simplest this exchange service could be a website where\ntraders, who can be individual persons, can post their rates, and\nrandom users can leave trade requests. Some kind of an average rate\nestimate could be shown on the site. Small-scale trading by\nindividuals would be outside legal hassle in most countries, and\nputting all the eggs in the same basket would be avoided.\n\nAnother idea, which could be additional to the previous one, would be\nan automated exchange service. The service would automatically\ncalculate the exchange rate and perform the transactions. This would\nbe nicer to the user: completion of the transaction request would be\ncertain and instantaneous. Making this service might actually be quite\neasy if there was a command line interface to Bitcoin: just take any\nweb application framework and use PayPal back-end integration to\nautomatically send euros when Bitcoins are received, and vice versa.\nThis kind of business would also work great on larger scale if you set\nup a company and take care of all the bureaucracy needed to practice\ncurrency exchange. (I actually have a registered company that I've\nused for billing of some IT work, I could use that as a base.)\n\nThis exchange business thing is something that I'd be interested in\ndoing, and I also have the sufficient technical skills to do it.\nAlthough, before this can be done, there should be a non-alpha version\nof Bitcoin (and the command line interface / API).\n\n\nIf this gets started, donors / high-risk investors would be very\nwelcome to bring capital for the currency's backup.\n\nSo, what do you think about the idea? Note that this is not something\nthat I'm asking you to do (unless you want to) if you're busy with\nother things. I can do it myself, if I get positive reviews about the\nplan.\n",

I had imagined an auction, but it would be far\nsimpler and more confidence inspiring to back it at a specific exchange\nrate.\n\nOffering currency to back bitcoins would attract freebie seekers, with\nthe benefit of attracting a lot of publicity.  At first it would mostly\nbe seen as a way to get free money for your computer's idle time.  Maybe\npitched like help support the future of e-commerce and get a little\nmoney for your computer's spare cycles.  As people cash in and actually\nget paid, word would spread exponentially.\n\nIt might help to keep the minimum transaction size above an amount which\na typical user would be able to accumulate with one computer, so that\nusers have to trade with each other for someone to collect enough to\ncash in.  Aggregators would set up shop to buy bitcoins in smaller\nincrements, which would add confidence in users ability to sell bitcoins\nif there are more available buyers than just you.\n\nPeople would obviously be sceptical at first that the backing will hold\nup against an onslaught of people trying to get the free money, but as\nthe competition raises the proof-of-work difficulty, it should become\nclear that bitcoins stay scarce.  People will see that they can't just\nget all the bitcoins they want.  It would establish a minimum value\nunder bitcoins enabling them to be used for other purposes if,\nhopefully, other purposes are waiting for something to use.\n\n\nThat would be more powerful if there was also some narrow product market\nto use it for.  Some virtual currencies like Tencent's Q coin have made\nheadway with virtual goods.  It would be sweet if there was some way to\nhorn in on a market like that as the official virtual currency gets\nclamped down on with limitations.  Not saying it can't work without\nsomething, but a ready specific transaction need that it fills would\nincrease the certainty of success.\n\n\nBasically like an eBay site with user reviews to try to establish which\nsellers can be trusted.  The escrow feature will help but not solve\neverything.  It would be far more work to set up such a site than just\nto set up a single exchange site of your own, and there won't be enough\nusers to make it go until later.  I'm thinking it wouldn't make sense to\nmake an eBay type site until later.\n\n\nEven if you had automation, you'd probably want to review orders\nmanually before processing them anyway.  It wouldn't be hard to process\norders by hand, especially at first.  You could always set a minimum\norder size to keep orders more infrequent.\n\n\nThat's great, I could probably get a donor to send currency to you which\nyou convert to euros and pay out through methods that are convenient for\nusers.  I don't want to do an exchange business myself, but it can be\ndone independently of me.  Like you say, there is more software\ndevelopment to be done first, and also I'd like to keep trying for a\nwhile to think of a bootstrap application to use bitcoins for.  I've had\nsome ideas that could only be done before an exchange exists.\n\nBTW, I tried to buy bitcoin.com before I started but there was no\nchance, it's owned by a professional domain speculator.  It's normal for\nopen source projects to have .org so it's not so bad.\n",

Without auto-run, we'll almost never\nretain nodes after an initial tryout interest.  Auto-running as a\nminimized tray icon by default was the key to success for the early file\nsharing networks.  It wouldn't have been appropriate for v0.1.0 when\nstability wasn't a given yet, but now it's good and stable.  This is a\nmust-have feature for the next release so any users that come back to\ntry the new version we hopefully retain this time.\n\nI think the most user friendly way of doing auto-run is putting an icon\nin the Startup folder.  I see OpenOffice.org and a number of other\nthings on my computer do it that way.  The other way, creating a runas\nregistry entry, is not easily visible or editable by users, I've never\nliked that much.  I guess what we want is an auto-run option that's on\nby default, if the option is changed then it creates or deletes the\nstartup icon.\n\nWhile it's tempting to do a Linux port, once we do it we have that extra\nwork with every release from then on.  I'd rather put it off a while\nlonger.  Auto-run might give us 300% more nodes while Linux might give\nus 3% more.  Linux would help server farms, but actually we'd like to\nfavour individual users.

Bitweaver's\nwiki and forum packages aren't so very highly advanced. SF hosting\nalso has its disadvantages, like the occasional slowness and lack of\ne-mailer and user IP retrieving.

There's a\nseveral step procedure you can do to run a password utility on unix and\ne-mail request an account that you could login with, but that's getting\npretty complicated.

Since you've been\nconnected before, your addr.dat contains known node addresses, but\nwithout IRC to know which ones are online, it takes a long time to find\nthem.  There are normally 1 to 3 other nodes besides you that can accept\nincoming connections, and existing nodes that already know you would\neventually connect to you.  How many connections did you get, and how\nlong did it take?  I guess to know whether it successfully connected\noutbound through TOR you'd need to search debug.log for \"connected\".\n\nTo originally connect with TOR without connecting normally once to get\nseeded, you'd have to know the address of an existing node that can\naccept incoming connections and seed it like this:\nbitcoin -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -addnode=<ip of a node>\n\nIf some nodes that accept incoming connects were willing to have their\nIP coded into the program, it could seed automatically.  Or some IP seed\naddresses posted on a Wiki page with the instructions.\n\nAnother option is to search the world again for an IRC server that\ndoesn't ban TOR nodes.  Or if we could get someone to set one up.  IRC\nservers ban TOR because they have actual text chat on them... if there\nwas one with just bots and junk then it wouldn't care.  Probably should\npost a question on the forum or the mailing list and see if anyone knows\none.\n\nAnother problem is that TOR users can't accept incoming connections, and\nwe have so few that can.  If everyone goes to TOR, there won't be any\nnodes to connect to.\n\nWe have a shortage of nodes that can accept incoming connections.  It\ngenerally ranges from 2 to 4 lately.

Because the first one was slow,\nit ended up requesting the blocks from everybody else, which only bogged\neverything down.  I can fix this, I just need to think a while about the\nright way.\n\nThere's no risk in shutting down while there are unconfirmed.  When you\nmake a transaction or new block, it immediately broadcasts it to the\nnetwork.  After that, the increasing #/confirmed number is just\nmonitoring the outcome.  There's nothing your node does during that time\nto promote the acceptance.\n\nNow that I think about it, when you close Bitcoin, it closes the main\nwindow immediately but in the background continues running to finish an\norderly flush and shutdown of the database.  Before I implemented that,\nit was annoying having a dead hung unresponsive window hanging around.\nUntil it finishes the orderly shutdown in the background, the port would\nbe locked, and this is an important protection to make sure another copy\ncan't touch the database until it's done.  I haven't seen the shutdown\ntake more than a few seconds.\n\nIn Wine, there's no way for the Windows version to do SO\\_REUSEADDR, so\nthat would add 60 seconds (on my system) of TIME\\_WAIT after the port is\nclosed.\n\nIf you need to transfer between two copies, you could send it to the\nother's bitcoin address.  The receiving copy doesn't have to be online\nat the time.\n\nThe command line to use a different data directory is\nbitcoin -datadir=<directory>\n\nFor example, on Linux, the default directory is (don't use ~)\nbitcoin -datadir=/home/yourusername/.bitcoin\n\nYou shouldn't normally have any need to use this switch.

I'm disabling the wallet flush\nfeature on Linux.  On Linux we'll never close a database handle until\nwe're ready to exit.  So far with this disabled, no exceptions.\n\nI'm also implementing the orderly initial block download.  Instead of\nnaively requesting all the blocks at once, it'll request batches of 500\nat a time.  This way, it'll receive the blocks before the retry timeout,\nso it shouldn't go requesting it from other nodes unless it actually\ndoesn't receive them or it's too slow.  The change is in the requestee's\nside, so this functionality won't be visible until your initial block\ndownload is coming from a node that has the new version.\n\nI'm going to test this some more before sending test8.\n\nLiberty Standard wrote:\n",

They're saying SMF is better\nwritten than phpBB and more reliable, so if I can get SMF to look right,\nthat's the preferable choice.\n\nMost forums run vBulletin (big-boards.com lists 1376 vBulletin, 275\nInvision, 245 phpBB and 41 SMF), so if you don't look like vBulletin or\nInvision, it looks like you compromised because you couldn't afford\nvBulletin.  SMF's UI started out further away from the standard look,\nbut I've been able to use CSS to make it look more like the others.\n\nI've done as much as I can with CSS, the rest requires editing PHP files\nand uploading images.  The forum doesn't have a built in file\nupload/edit admin feature, it's added separately as the SMF File Manager\nmod.  I uploaded the mod but some files need to be chmod 777 so it can\ninstall.  If you go to Admin->Packages->Browse Packages and click on\nApply Mod, it offers to do it automatically if you enter an ftp login.\n\nSomeone says you might also have to\nmkdir /var/www/bitcoin/smf/packages/temp\n\nThe error in the error log is:\nfailed to open stream: Permission denied\nFile: /var/www/bitcoin/smf/Sources/Subs-Package.php\n(I'm sure that's just the first file)\n\nIs it OK to go live with this SMF installation when I'm finished\nconfiguring it?

Either that or you could have them send to your IP\naddress, but then you have to rely on them to put the order number in\nthe comment.\n\nWhen generating the new address, there can be an option to add an entry\nto the address book associated with the address, so the received\ntransaction will be labelled.  I kinda hid the labels after early users\nfound them confusing, but it would be very helpful for this application.\nYou have to widen up the comment column to see them.\n\nAre you going to manually review and enter orders, at least to begin\nwith?  I sure would.\n\nI'm thinking I should move the UI in the direction of having the user\nask for their bitcoin address when they want one.  \"give me a bitcoin to\nreceive a payment with\".

I wouldn't give a script the access to my dollar reserves so\nlightly. The other way around (customer's dollars -> bitcoins) it\ndoesn't feel that insecure, and it's certainly nicer for the customer\nto receive his bitcoins immediately.\n\n",

Now there's the\n-blockamount command line option which asks the running instance for\nthe block chain length.\n\nI think this command line method could already be used from PHP, but\nit might be lighter if php itself could call the socket server\ndirectly. The wx's IPC overview mentions wxSocketEvent, wxSocketBase,\nwxSocketClient and wxSocketServer as being \"Classes for the low-level\nTCP/IP API\", which might be easier to use from php than what I used\nnow (wxServer, wxClient, wxConnection). I'll look more into it.\n",

All this is fine for UI code, since this\nis the same constraint placed by Windows anyway, but for UI-less server\ndaemon code, wx calls are uncertain.\n\nStatus of my research currently:\n\nFor PHP, Python, etc to access the server, we need to use regular\nsockets.  I think we can make it local-only by binding to localhost\nonly, so it can only be accessed through the loopback.  They say it's\nalso watertight to simply check the IP of connections received and\ndisconnect anything not 127.0.0.1.  May as well do both.\n\nXML-RPC is a bit fat.  There are 4 libraries for C++ but they're all big\nand hard to build, dependencies, license issues.

During 2010 most European\ncountries will become a part of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area),\nwhich means that all payments within Europe are to be considered\ndomestic.

The system is wide open to\ncopying plaintext credit card numbers and account numbers, and they deal\nwith it by reversing the transaction after the fact.  The system works\nfor physical goods that have to be delivered somewhere, and services\nwhich can't be resold.  It's a problem when it interfaces with precious\nmetals and currency conversion.\n\nThe first step of being easy in one direction, bitcoin->LR or anything\nof established value, goes a long way.  Even those who don't use the\nconversion still benefit from knowing that they could.  Trading bitcoin\nbecomes an easier way to trade the ability to claim LR, similar to how\npaper money was once the right to claim gold.  Nobody has to ever\nactually claim the LR to get the benefit of having the option that they\ncould if they wanted to.\n\nA lot of times you just need a minuscule amount of online currency.  The\nhassle of buying the other online currencies is too much for buying a\nsmall amount.  The ease of getting a small amount of bitcoin may help\nbootstrap an ecosystem of sellers of micropayment sized online goods\nselling to that market.  If the sellers can get LR for bitcoins, they're\nhappy, and that may be subsidized at first by investors who want to buy\nbc in large lots.\n\nThe main thing holding online currencies back is the lack of an easy way\nto get a small amount of currency.  Bitcoin opens that up.  It'll be the\nonly online currency that's both easy to cash out and easy to get a\nsmall amount.  It'll just be the usual harder difficulty to buy a large\namount.\n\nmmalmi@cc.hut.fi wrote:\n",

Maybe I can make it public soon.\n\nI divided the forum into 6 boards, which are Bitcoin Discussion,\nDevelopment & Technical Discussion, Technical support, Economics,\nMarketplace and Trading Discussion. Hope this is ok?\n\nI also added a page \"Trade\" on the bitcoin.org site, where\nbtc-accepting services are listed. It's nice to see that there are\nalready useful services that accept btc.\n\nThe community has been growing nicely. We've had around 10-20 people\nand active discussion at #bitcoin-dev lately.\n\nIt would be nice to get the daemon-able binaries to SF.net.

With the popularity\nof bitcoin addresses instead of sending by IP, we can't give the\nimpression it's automatically anonymous.  It's possible to be\npseudonymous, but you have to be careful.  If someone digs through the\ntransaction history and starts exposing information people thought was\nanonymous, the backlash will be much worse if we haven't prepared\nexpectations by warning in advance that you have to take precautions if\nyou really want to make that work.  Like Tor says, \"Tor does not\nmagically encrypt all of your Internet activities.  Understand what Tor\ndoes and does not do for you.\"\n\nAlso, anonymous sounds a bit shady.  I think the people who want\nanonymous will still figure it out without us trumpeting it.\n\nI made some changes to the bitcoin.org homepage.  It's not really\ncrucial to update the translations.  I tend to keep editing and\ncorrecting for some time afterwards, so if they want to update, they\nshould wait.\n\nI removed the word \"anonymous\", and the sentence about \"anonymity\nmeans\", although you worded it so carefully \"...CAN be kept hidden...\"\nit was a shame to remove it.\n\nInstead, I added Tor instructions at the bottom, with instructions for\nhow to stay anonymous (pseudonymous) directly after the Tor\ninstructions: \"If you want to remain anonymous (pseudonymous, really),\nbe careful not to reveal any information linking your bitcoin addresses\nto your identity, and use a new bitcoin address for each payment you\nreceive.\"\n\nIt helps that it can now seed automatically through Tor.\n\nEven though it doesn't say anonymous until the bottom, I think anonymous\nseekers would already suspect it based on all the other attributes like\nno central authority to take your ID info and the way bitcoin addresses\nlook.\n",
